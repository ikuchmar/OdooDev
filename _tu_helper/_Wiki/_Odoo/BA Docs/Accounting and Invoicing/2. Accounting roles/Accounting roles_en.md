welcome deodorants in this video about accounting rules within the company let's start with the internal team first and
more particularly the 

senior accountant 

the responsibility is to configure the basic setup of the accounting application
like the chart of accounts the journals and the taxes once this is done and the accounting is live they are responsible
for 
 - validating the invoices and the bills 
 - processing the payments and 
 - generating the legal reports 
 
to help them there's
also the accounting assistance whose responsibility is the day-to-day bookkeeping of the company meaning vendor was
encoding encoding the customer invoices processing the bank statements and managing the payment follow-ups we have to
say that these actions need to be done fast as the senior accountant needs to validate all those afterwards 
next
stakeholder within the internal team is the 

cfo the chief financial officer 

whose responsibility is to monitor the
financial health of the company and you know do they have different tools to uh to make sure that this works like in
legal reporting like balance sheet and profit and loss and some management tools like the analytic accounting and the
budget management based on all those information they're going to be able to take quick and efficient decisions for the
financial health of the company let's jump now to external stakeholders like the 

chartered accountant whose
responsibility is to close the tax period and the fiscal year of the company and to do so they need to review the
journal items uh that are within that period and they can check that through the balance sheet to the profit and loss
report they're going to have to make some adjustments if necessary in those entries and finally they will have to book
the closing journal entry next up is the auditor the auditor ensures that the financial statements are truthful and fair
to make sure that external stakeholders take decisions are rational relevant and reasonable and lastly we might have
some interactions with the authorities that can intervene to avoid fraud in your accounting for example for unreported
uh revenue tax report inconsistencies and paid taxes and so on you may see that all those are there we have a lot of
different stakeholders but they all work together with one application the accounting app on the internal side we're
gonna have the senior accountant that is going to set up the application then the accounting assistants are going to
book the entries within the app and that are going to be then validated by the senior accountant again and all those
information are going to be uh exploited from the cfo to make sure that the financial health of the company is insured
on the external side we might have some interactions with the chartered accountant to close our tax periods in our
fiscal year and also have a check from the auditor to make sure that our accounting is done properly and lastly the
authorities that will control that our accounting is done by the rules the accounting process is difficult but you need
to remember that everything uh all the responsibilities that we've talked about can be managed or within our application
our accounting application that's all for me in this video thank you for watching
